* compile with https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js (solc)
* run with https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm
* Jest fails to run solc properly so nodemon as the runner
* check out https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm/blob/master/examples/run-blockchain/index.js for running stuff on ethereumvm
* use step handler of the vm to debug the contract
